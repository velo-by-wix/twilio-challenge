# Trivia of the Day Text Service Challenge

Did you know you can integrate 3rd party services and APIs into your Velo enabled Wix web application? This challenge is to create a texting service that sends users a Trivia Question of the Day using Twilio and Velo!

Velo opens up an entire JavaScript web development platform on top of Wix so you can customize your site without additional maintenance headaches or extra hosting costs. If you want to learn more about Velo, check out [our site](https://www.wix.com/Velo/).
