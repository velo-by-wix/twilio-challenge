**:white_check_mark: Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. To create a database to store these inputs, click on the **Databases** icon on the left menu bar. The icon looks like a table.  

2. Create a new collection called "User List". Note the _collectionID_.

3. In this new collection (aka Database), make sure you have 2 fields: Name (text) and Phone Number (text). You can reuse the Title field and rename it Name.

> NOTE: Make sure to mark the phone number as PII!

4. In order to let anyone to submit to your database, you'll need to update the permissions of the collection. Click the 3 dots **...** and go to **Permissions & Privacy**. Change the _Can add content_ setting from _Admin_ to _Anyone_.
